hello. its 6:11 Thursday November 2nd. I expect this course to be a refresher on topics I am already familiar with. I found this course on sisu. Im looking forward to working with new data, using new visualizing techniques and some multivariate techniques. Im interested in dealing with missing data


This is an Introduction to Open Data Science course where we will look at visualizing and analyzing open data with multivariate statistical methods and follow practices that encourage open reproducible science.
